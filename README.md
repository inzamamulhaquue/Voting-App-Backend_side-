Built a Scalable Node.js Backend for a Voting Application Using Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT Authentication
Summary: A Highly Scalable Node.js Backend for a Voting Application Using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and designed and developed the secure Node.js backend and JWT authentication. JWT RESTful API design for authentication for modular user management and candidate management with registration, login and profile management using bcrypt for password hashing, including creation, updating and deletion, accessible only by administrators, With authentication using the Mongoose voting system. Along with voting and counting, role-based access control using MongoDB's atomic operations for data integrity using JWT authentication and middleware authentication. These technologies i have used in this project Node.js, Express.js (router, middleware, Error Handling) MongoDB Operations JWT Validation (Token Generation, Verification, Middleware).
	Asynchronous Programming Using Promises and Custom Middleware Input Validation and Async/Wait Error Handling and Logging Using Mongoose and Custom Validation Scalability and performance optimization techniques using For programming techniques Develop the frontend side of the application using React, HTML, and CSS, creating a seamless and amazing user experience that is fully integrated with the backend. Stay tuned for the full application launch! This summary demonstrates your expertise in Node.js backend development and sets the stage for your upcoming frontend development plans.
